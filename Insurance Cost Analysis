Final Project


Introduction


My project aimed to determine whether smoking status and region (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest) significantly impact insurance charges. Specifically, I wanted to see if smokers incur higher charges compared to non-smokers and whether insurance costs differ across regions. Understanding these relationships could help insurance providers identify how lifestyle and geographic factors influence healthcare costs, ultimately guiding pricing strategies and market targeting.


Methods


This project closely relates to concepts from class, particularly hypothesis testing and statistical analysis. For example, I used a t-test to compare the average insurance charges between smokers and non-smokers, a method we learned to analyze differences between two groups. Similarly, I applied ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) to test for differences in average charges across multiple groups, in this case, the regions. These methods align with the class discussions on testing means across two or more categories. Additionally, I explored correlations and regression analysis, which helped evaluate how variables like age and BMI influence charges, further reinforcing concepts from class.

Results



To approach the problem, I began by preparing the dataset. It included variables such as age, sex, BMI, children, smoking status, region, and insurance charges. I converted categorical variables like smoker and region into factors to ensure compatibility with statistical methods. For the t-test, I compared the mean insurance charges for smokers and non-smokers to evaluate if smoking status significantly impacts costs. 


My hypotheses were: the null hypothesis (H₀) stating no difference in charges and the alternative hypothesis (H₁) suggesting that smokers have higher charges. I found a significant difference, with smokers incurring much higher charges. For the ANOVA, I tested if charges differed across regions, with hypotheses assuming no differences (H₀) versus significant differences (H₁). This test revealed that geographic region does significantly influence insurance charges.


To visualize these relationships, I created boxplots. The first boxplot showed the distribution of charges for smokers and non-smokers, highlighting the stark cost difference. The second boxplot compared charges across regions, demonstrating variations in pricing based on geographic location. These visualizations made it easier to see how the data supported the statistical findings.

In conclusion, this study showed that smoking status and region are significant factors influencing insurance charges. Smokers consistently incurred higher costs, and regional differences were also evident. These insights emphasize the importance of considering both lifestyle and geographic variables when setting insurance premiums, as they play a crucial role in determining healthcare costs.
